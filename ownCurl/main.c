This is my solution for the Build Your Own curl coding challenge
found at - https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-curl

Development Notes:

    - Curl clone that can connect to a server and send GET, DELETE, POST, and PUT HTTP methods
    - Refer to RFC that defines HTTP, focus on HTTP 1.1 defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110

#include <main.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

    /* good luck */

    return 0;
}
