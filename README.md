# My Coding Challenges

This is a place for me to store my attempts and solutions to John Crickett's Coding Challenges

These are found at https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/


## Trying for yourself

Each coding challenge folder has it's own Makefile and test code

Simply run ```make``` inside the chosen folder and run ```./test``` ( and / or ```./main``` if solution allows for user input etc. )
