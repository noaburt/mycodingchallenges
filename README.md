# My Coding Challenges

This is a place for me to store my attempts and solutions to John Crickett's Coding Challenges

These are found at https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/


## Trying for yourself

Each coding challenge folder has it's own Makefile and test code, either as c or bash script

### C tests
Simply run ```make``` and then ```./test``` to run all tests

### Bash tests
Run ```chmod +x test.sh``` to make sure test is ready to run, then run ```./test.sh```

### User tests
Some coding challenges are basically a command line tool, this means user tests can be run too

Run ```make``` and interact with ```./main``` as with any other CLI tool
(run ```./main --help``` if you are unsure)
