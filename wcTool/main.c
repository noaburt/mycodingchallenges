This is my solution for the Build Your Own wc Tool coding challenge
found at - https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc

Development Notes:

  argc is number of arguments passed, argv is array of arguments as strings
  output is result of process followed by the file given
  -c outputs number of bytes in a file
  -l outputs number of lines

*/

#include <main.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

  /* Where the magic happens */
  
  printf("\n%s\n", argv[0]);

  /* basic error catching for arguments */

  return 0;
}
